Add print statements to understand what's going on, and then come up with your own variations.<br/><br/>If you have time, I'd love it if you submit a PR for changes in the community_contributions folder - instructions in the resources. Also, if you have a Github account, use this to showcase your variations.

      "\t* Monitor the individual's mental health symptoms during this period and adjust the transition as needed.\n",
      "4. **Communication**:\n",
      "\t* Schedule regular check-ins with the individual to monitor their progress, address concerns, and provide ongoing support.\n",
      "\t* Encourage open communication about any side effects, changes in mood or thought patterns, or difficulties adjusting to the new medication.\n",
